# Achievement-system
 My goal with this achievement system was to practice more with Unity's editor scripts.
 I wanted to see if I could fully customize an achievement from within the Unity Editor with the help of editor scripts.
 This goal has been accomplished, and I am very proud of the end result.

 I can select a requirement type I want the achievement to have and based on that result, I'll get to see the corresponding options. This can either be another 
 selection option, fill in option or check option. Some of these options can have corresponding results based on what has been selected and/or checked. 
 By doing this project I now know a lot more on how Unity editor scripts work and how I can use them for my future projects.
 
 I've also improved my custom scriptable object Unity events based on the feedback I got from a colleague programmer from school.
 I now know how to make a more abstract and generic scriptable object Unity event that I can use as a base for all my different types of Unity events.
 Working on this project was a lot of fun, and I've learned a lot from it, even though it took some time to fully practice and understand how it all works.
 This is something I can also reuse for my future projects as well.
